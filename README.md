# CodeClauseInternship_ATM-Interface

Project Title: ATM Interface Using Java

Project Description:
The aim of this project is to develop a simple ATM interface using Java that simulates the basic functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine. The interface will allow users to perform typical ATM operations such as checking balance, withdrawing funds, depositing funds, and changing their PIN.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Implement a login system that requires users to enter their account number and PIN to access their account. You can simulate user accounts using a data structure like a HashMap or an array.

Account Balance: Provide an option for users to check their account balance. Display the current balance once the user is logged in.

Withdrawal: Allow users to specify an amount to withdraw from their account. Make sure to implement checks to ensure that the withdrawal amount doesn't exceed the account balance.

Deposit: Implement a functionality for users to deposit funds into their account. Users should be able to specify the amount they want to deposit.

PIN Change: Provide an option for users to change their PIN. This should involve entering the old PIN and then specifying a new PIN.
